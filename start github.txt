Hello...every one!
Here are the steps for uploading any file from your local machines to github by gitbash.
First of all you need to download git in your machine..if you are using MAC great it's alrady there and if you are using windows or linux you have to install it.
Go to git-scm.com 
Hit the download and .exe file will be there just install it it's simple..NEXT NEXT NEXT...and done.
To upload files we will use some commands like:
1)ls--to lsit availble files
2)cd-- for the path // cd "path of the folder in inverted commas"
3)git init// wil creat .git folder
4)git remorte add origin <gitLink>// add your git repository link in inverted commas
5)git remort -v
6)git add . //(by writing . it  will add all the present files there in the folder...for perticular one file write file name insted)
7)git commit -m "First commit"  //(here if you are doing for the first time it will ask you "Who are you?" ...it will ask for your git hub mail and username....to do so...
Run git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name" )
8)git push origin master
and we are DONE...
Good Luck :)
